# Cyber Security Base - Project 1

This the first project in a University of Helsinki [Cyber Security Base MOOC](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi), in which the participant will construct software with security flaws and provide the steps to fix them.

Task is to create a web application that has at least five different flaws from the [OWASP top ten list](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) (plus CSRF which is missing from 2021 list, but is present in the 2017 list) as well as their fixes.

The flawed web application is built using Django as instructed and the website base/functionality is built according to [a tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/).

Python version used:
'''
$ python --version
Python 3.11.8
'''

Django version used:
'''
$ python -m django --version
4.2.10
'''

There will be a written report on the flaws/fixes.
