    The code for our vote() view does have a small problem. It 
    first gets the selected_choice object from the database, then 
    computes the new value of votes, and then saves it back to the 
    database. If two users of your website try to vote at exactly 
    the same time, this might go wrong: The same value, letâ€™s say 
    42, will be retrieved for votes. Then, for both users the new 
    value of 43 is computed and saved, but 44 would be the 
    expected value.

    This is called a race condition. 
    If you are interested, you can read Avoiding race conditions 
    using F() to learn how you can solve this issue.
